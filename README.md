# Surfs_Up

## Analysis Overview
This project utilizes the power of Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval methods in order to efficently produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii, in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop can successfully operate year-round. Specifically, summary statistics of temperature data were requested for the months of June and December.

## Results
- The average recorded temperatures in June was higher than the average temperatures in December, as one would expect.
- The standard deviation for temperature values is smaller than those for December, indicating temperatures do not vary all that much in June versus December.
- The median temperature in December is more inline with the average, and there are not many outliers skewing the average temperature higher or lower than the actual recorded frequency.

## Summary
After looking at the analysis results, opening a surf and ice cream shop on Oahu would be profitable. However, before moving forward, a couple more queries can shed more light on the project. For example, other stations' data throughout Oahu should be explored to determine best location within the island for the shop. Also, other data like percipiation, and wind speeds that can impact surf intensity can shed more light as to what months of the year one would expect to see lower revenues due to weather conditions.
